Codes for the multiple synchronous lung cancer project (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center)

This project involves 16 lung adenocarcinoma samples at different developmental stages obtained from 8 patients who underwent surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. 

Single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell TCR-seq and bulk whole-exome sequencing were performed on each tumour cell. Bulk whole-exome sequencing were performed on paired normal lung tissues as well.

Paper is now under review at Nature Communications.
